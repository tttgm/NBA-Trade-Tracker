# NBA-Trade-Tracker

**Aim:**
Plot the in-season movement via trade of players around the NBA.

**Why:**
Certain changes in the latest NBA collective bargining agreement (CBA) have led to shorter contracts, with more player/team options. This has seemed to invigorate the trade market, as more players are technically on "expiring" deals. I wanted to track in-season trades over the past few years to see what effect it had on the players' performance.

**How:**

To begin with, I'll try to create an interactive plot that looks at in-season player movement between teams historically. It will be interesting to see if any trends emerge with regards to a teams trade frequency with time, patterns in trading partners (and whether conference/division affects this), and overall volume of trades year-on-year.

On top of this, I'd like to extend this visualisation to highlight some advanced player metrics before & after the trade in order to assess what kind of impact moving teams mid-season might have on performance, or else demonstrate certain changes in opportunity a player may experience from going to a new situation.

**Scope:**

Hopefully I'll eventually extend this to off-season moves and acquisitions, however with generally more
roster turnover in off-seasons the effect on a single player (changing teams) can be harder to truely gauge. Additionally, a players performance may change dramatically between seasons naturally through summer workout regimes, while the negative effect of adjusting to a new environment would surely be lessened by the ability to partake in the teams training camp.

**Results:**

Some preliminary chord charts plotted using the Plotly library can be found in [this Notebook](https://github.com/tttgm/NBA-Trade-Tracker/blob/master/NBA-trade-tracker-chart.ipynb).
