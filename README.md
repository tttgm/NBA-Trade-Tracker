Data investigation into the effect of a mid-season trade on a players performance

Certain changes in the latest NBA CBA have led to shorter contracts, with more player/team options.
This has seemed to invigorate the trade market, as more players are technically on "expiring" deals.

I wanted to track in-season trades over the past few years to see what effect it had on the players' performance.

Hopefully I'll eventually extend this to off-season moves and acquisitions, however with generally more
roster turnover in off-seasons the effect on a single player (changing teams) can be harder to truely gauge.
